# Excavator
Moves files from a directory and its subdirectories to a single directory, for example if you've just extracted a year's worth of photos from your camera and don't want them to be in a dozen different folders. Made with [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6.5 and [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html).

# Installation
As the project has no dependencies outside default Python libraries, it can be used as is. (subject to change)

# TODO
- handling all kinds of inputs
- optional features, such as copying instead of moving and ignoring certain file types
- tests
