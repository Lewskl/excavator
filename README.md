# Excavator
Moves files from a directory and its subdirectories to a single directory, for example if you've just extracted a year's worth of photos from your camera and don't want them to be in a dozen different folders.

# TODO
- handling duplicate names
- handling all kinds of inputs
- optional features, such as copying instead of moving and ignoring certain file types
